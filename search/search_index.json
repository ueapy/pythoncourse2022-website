Follow the instructions below to set up your Python environment. Make sure you do this do this before the course, including running the test as below. There will be an installation party advertised in the invite email. Feel free to contact Jenny at Cefas or Eliza at UEA if you have any problems with the installation (but better do an internet search first!) Note: The course is designed in Python 3.8 but even if you have a different version installed, 3.8 will be installed when creating a conda environment in step 3 below. 1. Install Python distribution Cefas Users We do not have free access to Anaconda, so please use a free alternative such as Mamba instead. For those in academia, we also recommend this as a more lightweight (and often faster) python installation option! 1.1.a Download Mambaforge for your OS 1.2.a After downloading, follow the instructions as suggested here Students or UEA Staff 1.1.b. Download Anaconda with Python 3 for your OS . 1.2.b. Install it following these instructions . Be sure to select install \"just me\" when prompted. UEA HPC (Ada) Following the course, there are a number of modules available for use of python on Ada, using either mamba or anaconda. However, for the purpose of this course, we recommend viewing the notebooks on your own machine. 2. Download course materials From monday before the course (25th April) the material for the workshop can be downloaded as a zip file or can be cloned from our GitHub repository . Option 1: Download ZIP file (easier) Download the materials as a zip file and unpack it in a suitable directory, for example, in Downloads folder. Jump to 3. Create the environment . Option 2: Using Git (allows restoring originals after modifications) 2.1. Install Git If you don't have git version control system installed, you can install it following these instructions: Linux Use your package manager. For example, using aptitude you would run the following terminal command: sudo apt-get install git Mac The XCode command line tools need to be installed. Install XCode if it isn\u2019t already. XCode is available in the Mac App Store for free. Launch XCode and accept the license agreement. Quit XCode. Open a new terminal and run the command xcode-select --install Select install on the pop-up menu. Windows Download and install Git for Windows . 2.2. Clone the repository 2.2.1. Open the command line (Git bash, terminal or cmd.exe) 2.2.2. (Linux or Mac, optional) Change to a suitable directory (e.g. cd /home/yourname/Documents ) 2.2.3. Clone the repo by typing git clone https://github.com/ueapy/pythoncourse2022-materials.git This should create a local copy of the course materials in the current directory. Windows-users, double check that it has been cloned in the directory you wanted. 3. Create the environment 3.1. Make sure Anaconda or Mambaforge is installed and the course materials are downloaded 3.2. Open the command line or python prompt (i.e., search \"Terminal\" on Mac Spotlight Seach; search \"Anaconda prompt\" or \"mamba\" on Windows start menu) 3.3. Navigate to folder containing the cloned / downloaded course materials. Use the cd command, for example: cd C:\\Users\\myname\\Downloads\\pythoncourse2022-materials\\ 3.4. Create the environment using conda package manager: conda env create -f environment.yml This will take some time depending on your Internet speed (<15 minutes). If you installed mamba, you can use a faster option: mamba env create -f environment.yml If you get stuck try typing return or, failing this, creating the environment again. 4. Activate the environment Linux / Mac If your default shell is NOT bash, first type bash . Activate the relevant environment by typing: conda activate course2022 Windows Still in the command line (Anaconda/mamba prompt), type: conda activate course2022 5. Test the installation (essential!) From the terminal type: python -c \"import seaborn\" If you don't get any errors then your installation was sucessful. 6. Launch Jupyter Once the environment is activated, type jupyter notebook in the command line. This should open Jupyter Notebook in your browser. Still having trouble? If you are unable to install Anaconda Python on your PC, contact the course organisers . Another option: launch the course in the cloud! . This requires no installation but progress and modifications won't be saved.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#installation-instructions","text":"For this course you will need to have Python installed on your laptop, inlcuding some extra packages.
